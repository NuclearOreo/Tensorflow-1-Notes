# My Note on Tensorflow

Getting familiar with Tensorflow 1.13 by in trying to create 
bunch of neural networks for classic problems. Bacis regression, classification
convolutional and recurrent network. Then hopefully move on to GANs, autoencoder
and harder problems.

## Python environment and packages  I'm using

```
python 3.7
tensorflow 1.13
jupyter
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
sklearn
gym
```
